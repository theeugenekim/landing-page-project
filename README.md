# landing-page-project

Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px.
